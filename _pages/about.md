Jake grew up in Trumbull, CT where his acuity in mathematics and creativity led him on his way to becoming an architect. 
Jake was accepted to the Rhode Island School of Design, where in his freshmen year, he realized his passion for architecture was rooted in the ideals of graphic design. After attending a lecture overviewing the Graphic Design department, Jake knew that was the direction we was supposed to take. Jake officially declared Graphic Design his major in the tail end of his freshmen year and has never looked back. His studies revealed a deep passion for visual systems and identity design, which remain a driving focus of his career to this day.

In addition to graphic design, Jake took introductory HTML classes in college and fell in love with the medium. He blazed through every course that was available, and translated that knowledge into curriculum he taught, with guidance from his professors, for RISDâ€™s Branding for Web course.

After his graduation, Jake moved to Brooklyn, NY and began working as an in-house designer for Time Warner Inc. where he developed branding, marketing collateral, event signage, and web design for the many brands within the Time Warner Inc. umbrella.

Jake Cooper Design is the moniker for his freelance endeavors, allowing Jake to work on select professional projects and launch products and ideas of his own. 

Outside of work, Jake is a TV & Film fanatic, as well as an avid guitar player and musician. 

Jake currently commutes to New York from his apartment in Stamford, CT that he shares with his lovely girlfriend, Cait.
